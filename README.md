Data scientist with a strong computer science background. I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a

Python Developer and ML Engineer at a startup company and have demonstrated experience in building
machine learning models, implementing microservices to expose them at scale in production
environments by using text mining and harvesting techniques. As an individual, I can be described by my
ambitions, eagerness and hardworking personality, while as a team member, I am highly collaborative,
